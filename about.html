<h1>About Us - Who's on the Masoom_1113 team?</h1>
Meet the team behind the website you've been reading, plus find out what they're playing and watching right now.</p>
<p>
Welcome to Masoom_1113! We are the games, movies, and TV website that upgrades your downtime; helping you make the most of your money, skills, and time. </p>
<p>

On Masoom_1113 we always aim to inform, entertain, and inspire through our mix of news, reviews, features, tips, buying guides, and videos. </p>
<p>

We are not condescending, elitist, assumptive, or deliberately argumentative. We are a celebratory site that looks to remind readers that <br>games and entertainment are a force for good and for bringing people together.</p>
<p>

Masoom_1113 is also home to some of the biggest brands in the industry: Edge, Play, Retro Gamer, Newsarama, Total Film, and SFX.</p>
<p>

Masoom_1113 takes pride that our reviews and best lists are independent and free from any commercial considerations. <br>We never take money for reviews or for placements in our best lists and buying guides. </p>
<p>

Our team will sometimes take trips and other hospitality to attend shows or see products. That doesn't affect <br>how we think or write about those products or games, but it does affect whether we can cover certain products or events, particularly when otherwise we would not have had that coverage opportunity.</p>
<p> 

The majority of review products are sent to us by the companies involved, and the majority are a direct result of a review request.<br>We only review products that we have selected ourselves and that are worth reviewing. We always return products on request or at the end of our agreed loan period. </p>
<p>

Masoom_1113 is a member of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (which regulates the UK’s magazine and newspaper industry).<br> We abide by the Editors’ Code of Practice and are committed to upholding the highest standards of journalism. If you think that<br> we have not met those standards and want to make a complaint please contact us at masoomrajliwal2@gmail.com. <br>If we are unable to resolve your complaint, or if you would like more information about IPSO or the Editors’ Code,<br> contact IPSO on 90xxxxxxxx or visit masoomrajliwal2@gmail.com</p>
